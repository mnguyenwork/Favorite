# My Favorite Activity
## Summary
Singing is totally my all-time favorite activity. I could spend hours just humming away to my favorite tunes or having a wild karaoke session at 2 in the morning, right in my own room. Let's not forget those epic shower concerts! Sometimes, I get lost watching my favorite singers, singing along like there's no tomorrow. Learning basic vocal techniques from YouTube is also enjoying to me.
